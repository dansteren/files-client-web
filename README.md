# Installing

Right now this project is only available as source code. You'll need to build the project from scratch and then install.

# Devloping

To get started use the VS Code [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension. This will start up a local dev server for viewing the files.
